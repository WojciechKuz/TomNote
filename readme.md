### TomNote notification app üìù
All this app does is sending notifications.
But why? Some smartwatches do not offer text viewing like notes.
However, some of this watches allow you to read notifications on your smartwatch.

The purpose of this app's existence is just that. It allows you to view text on your smartwatch through notifications.
Using my app:
1. Connect your smartwatch to the smartphone 
2. Type some text
3. press the button to send notification
Voila! You have some notes on your smartwatch!

Unlike my other projects, even the more advanced ones, this app has an active user!
